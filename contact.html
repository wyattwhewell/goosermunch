        <p>While I appreciate your interest in contacting Goose, Goose is a dog. Therefore, she is very difficult to get ahold of. I am honestly not sure what you thought you would accomplish by going to this page. I only included it becasue it seemed like a webite should have a "Contact" page.</p>
        <p>For one thing, she does not speak English. Or any other language for that matter. Once again, she is a dog.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but she doesn't have any thumbs, which makes posting to social media almost impossible for her. Although, you will likely have luck finding her on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/squiddy2319/" target="_blank">Instagram account</a> of her mother.</p>
